# Machine-Learning-Projects

Welcome! I made this repository to demonstrate most of the scikit-learn based machine learning projects I've worked on. This repository will primarily centered around the real and the toy datasets provided by scikit-learn. Outside of this repo, there are several other machine learning projects I have worked on and am still working on. This repo was moreso designed to act as a learning tool for me, where I spend time learning new models and trying new techniques using all the datasets provided by scikit learn. If I work on a project with real data collected that does not exist in a scikit learning dataset, that project would likely not be found in this repository. If you have any suggestions about any code you see, please feel free to let me know! None of these projects are closed, and I am more than happy to receive feedback.
