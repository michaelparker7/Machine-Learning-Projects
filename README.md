# Machine-Learning-Projects

Welcome! I made this repository to demonstrate some of the machine learning projects I have worked on and am still working on. Projects in here come from both scikit-learn and tensorflow. Most of these projects will likely have a come from a toy dataset or from a tutorial. This repo was designed to help me learn material. If I work on a more creative project with real data (data that does not exist in a toy dataset or a tensorflow tutorial), it will likely not be found in this repository. If you have any suggestions about any code you see, please feel free to let me know! None of these projects are closed, and I am more than happy to receive feedback.
